# Student Web Access [Actual Name TBD]

### Project Members: Avery Buehler, James Pinckney, Jacob Pfeiffer

Student Web Access is a multi-user web-service primarily designed for students to be able to sign up and manage their personal and contact information, financial aid, classes, academic records, financial records, account holds, and preview schedule. Professors and other faculty can also manage students in order to override any special requirements for classes, add or remove students from classes, advise students, and input grades as needed. The application will use more modern web and database technologies, implementing a more secure, navigable, and reliable interface than those that some previous student management technologies were built upon; This will be following a method known as “Full-Stack” development, which allows the database, back-end, and front-end to be integrated together faster, cheaper, and with more ease.

## Meetup Schedule
- Tuesday from 12:15 to 1:15
- Thursday from 12:15 to 1:15
